Key Features of the Script

- **NLP Module**: Utilizes the GPT-2 model for text generation and logging responses.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Implements a PPO model to learn and act in a simulated environment (CartPole).
- **Computer Vision Module**: Captures video from the webcam and displays it.
- **Multi-Agent System**: Simulates communication between agents.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Maintains and logs context information.
- **Blockchain Module**: Interacts with a blockchain node to send transactions.
- **Web Scraping Module**: Scrapes data from a website.
- **Self-Improvement Module**: Tracks performance metrics and optimizes based on performance.
- **Decision-Making Module**: Randomly decides on actions for the AI.
- **Event Handling Module**: Simulates handling events from an external API.

### Notes for Further Development

1. **Blockchain Integration**: Replace `"YOUR_BLOCKCHAIN_NODE"` with your actual blockchain node.
2. **Real Web Scraping**: Change the URL in the WebScrapingModule to a valid endpoint.
3. **Environment**: Ensure the required libraries (`transformers`, `stable_baselines3`, `opencv-python`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `web3`) are installed in your Python environment.
4. **Thread Management**: The current implementation starts threads for each module and waits indefinitely. You may want to implement more sophisticated thread management and termination conditions.
5. **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling via logging; consider expanding this based on specific requirements.

This script can serve as a robust starting point for your Autonomous AI project. If you have additional features or modifications in mind, feel free to specify, and I can assist in implementing those changes.
